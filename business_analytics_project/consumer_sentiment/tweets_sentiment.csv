Promised to deliver by 5.48pm and the rider tells he has picked up the order now. Utter disgusting. ,2020-07-31 12:24:26+00:00,0,0,@Zomato @ZomatoIN @zomatocare,
1381,@ZomatoIN @Zomato Hello sir There's a suggestion In lockdown many places food delivery is not available or Zomato is not working There's a idea 1) Zomato app will be used by customer for ordering 2) let homemade food providers deliver food themselves This will help many,2020-07-31 14:32:33+00:00,0,1,@ZomatoIN @Zomato,
